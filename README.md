# Pong

Hi there! This small game of Pong was just a small project on the side to teach myself a good workflow for making a game. 

You can choose to play with a friend or play against the CPU. 

The controls for '1 Player' are 'W' to go up and 'S'  to go down. You can press the 'Escape' key to pause or resume the game. 

The controls for '2 Players' are 'W' to go up and 'S' to go down for player 1 (left hand side of screen ) while they are the up arrow key 
to go up and down arrow key to go down for player 2 (right hand side of screen). You can also still press the 'Escape' key to pause or 
resume the game. 

I hope you enjoy!
